wake smashing success rumble bronx looking likely jackie chan film see american release rumor one film drunken master ii version copy laserdisc widescreen bilingually subtitled hong kong film day availability united state limited film must either purchased via pirate sought asian distributor tai seng subtitling copy slightly hard read letter white bit small although american release almost certainly dubbed review subtitled version please keep mind reading review help decide whether go see fair must admit never fond period piece martial art movie one set nebulous china distant distant past perhaps seen filmed inferior stock either butchered dubbing illegible subtitling perhaps plot tend similar many case nonexistant fact many get wrapped subplots seem forget main plot entirely minute end matter might jackie chan film modern setting armour god rumble bronx etc tend spectacular stunt often involving large motor vehicle large explosion whereas period piece simply martial art said must turn right around say drunken master ii remarkable exception one better martial art film seen quite enjoyed surprised well drunken master ii young man named wong fei hong played jackie chan master drunken boxing style kung fu learned style uncertain father wong kei ying ti lung steadfast opposition fei hong practicing rather normal style kung fu apparently fei hong sort figure chinese folklore rather like paul bunyan american heard little could quite well wrong leave analysis people know better one friend point character wong fei hong also featured upon time china movie yet seen plot drunken master ii somewhat hazy plot many film watching jackie chan film odds expecting something order war peace story seems revolve around evil foreigner spiriting away ancient chinese relic hence china cultural heritage overworking underpaying beating chinese worker nearby steel mill however plot merely serf framework main story film fei hong perpetual struggle win girlfriend supplicate father keep pregnant mother played anita mui fighting keep getting beaten evil foreigner thug macguffin drive plot precious antique jade imperial seal taken away evil foreigner beginning fei hong accidentally steal trying recover identically wrapped box containing medicinal ginseng father bringing back customer process clash another thief trying seal end instead ginseng fei hong narrowly avoids getting caught seal evil foreigner lackies thanks timely intervention general son cameo appearance andy lau would later take starring role drunken master iii comedic chaos ensues back wong household fei hong mother attempt come replacement missing ginseng go plot thickens later fei hong girlfriend maneuver kung fu match rival fei hong thief revealed loyalist manchu officer trying recover seal stop evil foreigner attacked en masse another grand kung fu movie tradition think already spent time plot really deserves let move real draw jackie chan movie action plenty martial art action found movie course kung fu film expected however another kung fu movie one jackie chan fight stunt choreography jackie chan genius primary martial art style featured film drunken boxing form kung fu attempt draw adversary guard making seem like fellow using drunk purpose film least drunken boxer fight better actually intoxicated fine line drunk enough drunk stupor normal circumstance idea someone staggering around looking sloshed managing fight effectively even incredibly might seem rather stupid jackie pull flair kung fu sequence intricate staging execution pointless try describe paper say fight especially big climactic fight end make movie worth watching another thing drunken master ii going stunt work even without motor vehicle well counting train remarkable stunt film among thing jackie dive balcony table crawl across hot coal least twice count outtake shown credit quicktime movie stunt found www movie database unlike american film stunt faked drunken master ii star several veteran actor hong kong movie scene including jackie ti lung better tomorrow anita mui heroic trio series rumble bronx performance first rate especially come comedy part film scene fei hong mother conspire literally behind fei hong father back cover missing ginseng root hilarious scene fei hong mother revealed pregnant threatening hurt order draw husband anger away fei hong jackie developed knack physical comedy sort mastery year fine form drunken master ii far cinematography concerned certainly work film nothing spectacular least dozen time better old kung fu movie picture crisp clear one thing find particularly worthy mention least copy screen wider film ever seen videotape almost whole screen blocked watch bigscreen tv movie theater utter shame film eventually pan scanned american video release drunken master ii show full potential period piece kung fu movie good enough overcome even usual distaste movie plot meander bit expected type film like kind movie love
